\section{Brief description}
We will here shortly describe what the Zifra card is meant to be.
It is an memory card that is supposed to protect data by encrypting the data that is written to it.
This is done with the help of multiple \gls{keys} and \gls{cipher}.

\section{System overview}
We will here describe the way we want the system to work.
For the case\todo{case->sake} of explanation we will use a camera as an example case.
We will first talk about the key generation, secondly the encryption and finally about decryption step.

\subsection{Key generation}
There are three type of keys used in the crypto scheme.
The first two keys are pre-generated as an key pair on a safe device one \acrfull{priKey} and one \acrfull{pubKey}.
The pri\_key is saved for later use and the pub\_key is transferred and saved on the SD card see Figure \ref{fig:key_gen}.
Then the user puts the SD card in a camera.
When the camera boots up a random number is generated this is the \acrfull{randKey} this number is then encrypted with the Pub\_key and saved on the memory.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{ilustrations/Key_generations.pdf}
	\caption{This illustration shows where the keys are generated and where they are stored}
	\label{fig:key_gen}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
\newpage
\subsection{Encryption}
The Rand\_key\footnote{This is the non encrypted random key.} is then used as the key input in the chacha cipher to encrypt the data before it is saved to the memory see Figure \ref{fig:encrypt}.
When the system is powered off the Rand\_key that is only stored in the FPGA disappears due to the nature of an FPGA.
The generation and encryption of the Rand\_key is repeated for each session.
So there will be multiple enc\_Rand\_key:s stored on the memory one for each session.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{ilustrations/encryption.pdf}
	\caption{Basic data flow in encryption step}
	\label{fig:encrypt}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
\newpage
\subsection{Decryption}
When decrypting the data one extracts the encrypted data and the \acrfull{encRandKey} on to the safe device were the Pri\_key is saved.
Then we use the Pri\_key to decrypt the enc\_Rand\_key:s and then we can use the Rand\_key:s to decrypt the data see Figure \ref{fig:decrypt}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{ilustrations/decryption.pdf}
	\caption{basic data flow in decryption step}
	\label{fig:decrypt}
\end{figure}

\section{Hardware}
The hardware was intended to be an \acrfull{pcb} with an \acrfull{fpga} with an memory and some support component.
The FPGA that we use is the Artix7 t35.


\section{sd slave progress}
The SD slave comes form the Google vault project \cite{GV}.
This part of the project does not work yet.

We have extracted the blocks that we think are needed for the project.
There is a test bench to test and send commands to the design and see what responses the device sends back.
So far we can read and write from the first sector in the memory but not to any other sector.

\subsection{Development environment}

Here I will state the steps to get the debugging platform working.
The system is designed for the Arty z7 board.

First start the Vivado project.
Second we need to set the board to jtag boot mode this is done with an jumper on the board.
Follow this with a power cycle.
Open hardware manager and open target.
Right click on the FPGA to add configuration memory device\footnote{If this does not work it might mean that you might need to remove an old one, right click on the memory and choose remove}.
\begin{table}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l|r}
		Function		& Setting		\\
		\hline
		Manufacturer	& Spansion  	\\
		Settings 		& Value  		\\
		Density  		& 256  			\\
		Type 			& qspi  		\\
		Width 			& x4-single
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{This table includes settings for configuring the memory on the Arty z7 board.}
	\label{table:memorySettings}
\end{table}

This produces two results we pick the \emph{3.3V} version and press "ok".
Vivado now asks if we want to program it we say "ok".
Now we need to pick the \emph{.elf} and \emph{boot.bin} files.
The boot.bin lives in the root of the project.
And the \emph{fsbl.elf} file resides in \texttt{*.sdk\textbackslash fsbl\textbackslash Debug}.
Then program.
Set boot jumper to spi mode and power cycle.

Then I used minicom\footnote{minicom is an text based terminal emulator} to connect to the system baud rate 115200.
mmc info shuld give info about the device.
Use \texttt{read mmc 0 0 1} to read first sector and \texttt{write mmc 0 0 1} to write first sector.


\section{chacha}
The stream cipher that used for the data encryption is called chacha \cite{chacha} developed by Joachim Strömbergson \cite{joachim}.
We have made an axi ip block out of it, one stream port for the data and one address port for the setting example iv and key see Figure \ref{fig:chacha}.
There is an test bench that show how the axi block is intended to be used.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{ilustrations/chacha.pdf}

\end{figure}


\section{Helpful data}
This section will list information that has been collected during the project that might help further development.

\subsection{CSD list}
During the debugging we listed the CSD values that was used in the \gls{gvsdslave} we also made an list of the other CSD and CID values.
We list the CSD list 1.0, 2.0 and the CID list also the original CSD settings from the Google Vault.

\section{Whishlist}
Here we will list some features that we would like to have in the future.
Theese are extras but good to have.

\subsection{Hidden files}
We would like to have the possibility to hide the files so that every time you start up the memory card it looks empty.
This would be done by making an temporary FAT table that is used during the session then hidden between the \gls{mbs} and the real FAT table.

\subsection{See pictures when camera is still on}
We would like to be able to look at the pictures during the session.
This would mean that the cipher needs to work in both directions during the session.

\subsection{Fake pictures}
We would also like to be able to prep the memory card with fake data in the camera case that would be preloaded with pictures.
These would show up if someone would inspect the card.
This would also be helped by the see pictures while session is active if the system is tested.
