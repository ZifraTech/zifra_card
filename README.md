## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The repos are generated using Vivado 2017.4.
The FPGA used is an Artix-7 (xc7a100tcsg324-2) but can easely be modified to be used on other FPGA.
The test bench fore the chacha uses an microblaze so this needs Vivado to work.


### Installing
	Not aplicable

## chacha test

In the chacha folder there is an tb and some sorce files.
To run the testbench create an vivado project and add thees files to it.
